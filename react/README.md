# Learning react

## Some building tips:
* Write down all components (organize them based on the data model);
* Write static react (this.props);
* Write dynamic react (this.state);
* Write two-way binds (use events to update state of parent);

## General tips:
* In source, class variables use CamelNotation and start uppercase;
* Each object has a render member that returns a div, whose className property is lowercase variable name;
